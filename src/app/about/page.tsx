<h1>Hey there! I’m [Your Name], a front-end web developer with a passion for creating clean, responsive, and intuitive digital experiences. I specialize in crafting modern websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React and Next.js. Whether it’s building from scratch or bringing a design to life, I focus on writing efficient code and creating smooth, user-friendly interfaces that feel just right on any screen.

I’m all about that balance between creativity and functionality — the kind of work that not only looks good but also performs beautifully. I love experimenting with new tools, staying up to date with front-end trends, and continuously improving my skills. When I’m not coding, I’m probably geeking out over UI animations or planning my next side project. Let’s build something cool together!
